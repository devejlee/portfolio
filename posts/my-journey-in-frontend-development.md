### WordPress and Fencing

For whatever reason, I searched "What is HTML?" in Google and began reading a [book](https://htmlandcssbook.com/sample-chapter/) about basic HTML & CSS. As a naive freshman college student, I thought I could learn just by reading pages of code. So after 200 pages, I was feeling quite confident that I knew a thing or two about HTML and CSS. It wasn't until I opened a Windows Notepad in my school library and tried to write HTML that I realized I didn't know much coding at all.

I searched how to make websites without coding on YouTube and found a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0Dx7fmAINM) on making a WordPress website with a drag-and-drop builder. After  spending hours figuring out how to stop [Skype from using my localhost port](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30415201/apache-needs-port-80-mamp) and installing MAMP to have a local PHP and MySQL server to run WordPress on my Windows laptop, I started following YouTube tutorials on how to make blogging and e-commerce WordPress sites.

Back then, I was part of my university fencing club, and we had a very old WordPress website with outdated design. I offered to redesign the website for free to practice my WordPress website design skills. After borrowing a camera and hiring 2 friends with a chicken dinner, we took photo shoots of differnt fencing facilities. With the drag-and-drop builder, it was easy to create uniform layouts and modify the font-size and text color and make everything mobile-responsive. And soon enough, I had my first WordPress website on the web.

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

After familiarizing myself with WordPress, I wanted to challenge myself by making a website with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was inspired by a website that showcased the history of website development in chapter format to make a similar website for my short stories I wrote for a college writing class. I learned how to use Github and Github Pages to host my small website for free. It's honestly pretty cringe looking back at [my writing](https://eliya33.github.io/stories/index.html), but it helped me prepare for the next project I had in mind. 


My new goal was to make a multipage mobile responsive website by the end of the semester. The fact that I was taking classes didn't help as I was taking a month struggling to make a mobile responsive menu bar. I referred to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to learn the web basics. I had my mind blown when I used ([some pretty bad](https://codepen.io/eliya33/pen/jwGZmP)) JavaScript for the first time to change class names with an `onClick` function to make my mobile menu bar interactible. Looking back, the design is objectively horrible but back then that was my biggest project so far, and the fact that I could interact with the [final product](https://eliya33.github.io/church/index.html) on my phone made me so happy.

The next year was soon approaching and I didn't have much time before my 2 year [mandatory military service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_South_Korea). My last project before I went was to create a WordPress website with the same drag and drop builder I learned all those years ago for my college newsmagazine club that only distributed their articles on physical copies at the end of the semester. I suggested they could use a CMS to share articles onlines, and I was willing to work for free. So after getting a domain from of Godaddy and spending the hot Korean summer coding in a cafe, I made my last WordPress website and was conscripted into the Republic of Korea Air Force.

### Military, Poetry, and React

While serving in the air force, a close college professor contacted me for a favor. She wanted a website for students to make reservations for our newly formed writing center to help struggling students improve their writing skils. She had asked our college office to make a website, but the bureaucracy and slow response made her frustrated enough to ask me while I was in the military. I was happy to comply, but I told her that I couldn't access my Github with the military computers. So I needed a paid [codepen](https://codepen.io/your-work) pro account to develop and stores files via codepen. I also could only use the computers for "educational purposes" after 10:00 PM, so I told her it would also take some time. She happily had the college pay the yearly subscription and I used Bootstrap and an iframe reservation widget and made a working website within 2 weeks. She was pleased with the result and had the college pay me around $150 for my work although I didn't even ask.

Now that I had a codepen PRO account, I could start my biggest project yetâ€”to recreate my college website from scratch. I chose HTML, SASS, and JavaScript for my tech stack and referred to other university websites for the design. CSS Grid and Flexbox were just coming out at this time, and I used them with discretion with the [`@supports`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports) rule and used the now deprecated float and [clearfix](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_clearfix.asp) hacks as fallbacks.

During the work day I would sketch layout designs on my military notepad and after the roll call in the evening, I would apply to use the computer room and work from around 10:00-11:00 PM. Then I would wake up at 6:30 AM in the morning and start all over again. After my first vacation break, I ate a bad pork cutlet and ended up being hospitalized for a day because of [gastroenteritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis). After spending the day in the hosptial, I wondered if I should work on the website or take a day off. I decided to just work that hour because I told myself if I could work after getting hospitalized, I could work when I was feeling lazy. (This was not a healthy mentality and I would face the repercussions later).

I remember it being quite cold in the winter as there was no heating in the computer room and wearing earmuffs while typing on the old Windows computer. It was brutally slow progress. I questioned why I was even putting in the effort at times and if I even wanted to be a frontend developer at all. But I like to finish what I started, and after a little over a year, I was [done](https://devejlee.github.io/uic/).

Now that I felt very comforatble with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I knew it was time to learn React. Along with working on my website, I was also reading [The Tale of Genji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji) on my Kindle for the past year. I had written 18 poems reminiscent of Heian Japanese poetry, and I decided to make a simple React app showcasing them. I drew unique shapes for each poem using Figma and learned the now deprecated class component React architecture to make [my first React app](https://devejlee.github.io/andair/). 

My military service was finishing in the first year of January of 2020. I would return to college as a senior and was excited to return to school. There's no way something like a global pandemic could stop me from enjoying my last year in college, right?

### Gatsby and Job Applications

Good news: I was out of the military. Bad news: The coronavirus was disrupting the lives of billions of people all over the world. All classes were online, which gave me more time to focus on my next big project: remaking the WordPress website I made for my college newmagazine club with Gatsby and React. I realized that hosting the WordPress site was costing the club $200 every 6 months, and thought it was both my responsibility to bring that cost to $0 and thought it was an excellent opportunity to learn Gatsby and the wonders of static site generators.

I made a [design mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/NK6Nc7H6AtACiu5ukZxU2F/Scribe?node-id=0%3A1&t=kGQIKIDP0X7QtvAD-1) with Figma and after migrating around 200+ articles accumlated over 2 years in Wordpress and converting them into Markdown through an open-source [script](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown), I got to work. I organized the articles into 11 categories, turned those categories into separate pages, and used GraphQL to filter the markdown data to only show articles for their respective category per page. I also added a search bar to query the articles with Algolia and deployed the [final product](https://yonseiuicscribe.netlify.app/) on netlify.

The first semester of my senior year finished, and I had one last project left before I started applying for jobs. I made another [design mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/nfPAa7RIifPmbdD0n69Yqa/Portfolio-Website?node-id=0%3A1) for my first portfolio website, and finished development within 2 months. I updated my LinkedIn and only included the website I made during my military service and the Gatsby website I recently made in my resume becuase I thought they were my best work. Classes were still online as my final semester of senior year began. I had fulfilled enough credits beforehand to only need to take 2 more classes for graduation so I could spend the majority of my time applying for jobs.

I applied to mostly startups via Korean job sites. But after four months and over 50 applications, the end of the year was approaching with no offers. I had two in-person interviews under my belt, but both resulted in nothing. One day I suddenly received a message from a CEO of a small startup who said he was interested in interviewing me. It was going to be done over Zoom, and I tried to prepare as best as I could when the day approached. I remember him asking me what I knew about REST apis and I answered what I knew about GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. He also looked over my resume and said that I studied technology that wasn't relevant to the current job market, but said he admired my passion for learning. He offered me the job that was located in Seoul, but I was living in Incheon at the time and it would take roughly an hour and a half to get to work. He told me that he'd give me a few days to think over it, and if I couldn't take the job, he said he would like to recommend me to a couple of his friends.

I was ecstatic that I had an offer on the table. And as luck would have it, a CTO from a different startup contacted me for another job interview. We had a 30 minute discussion, and he texted me the final offer with a salary that was higher than my first offer. The location was nearer to my home, and so I made my choice. I contacted the first CEO and thanked him for everything but replied that I decided to take my second offer.

I had not even graduated yet but I already had a job secured. All those years of work and planning had finally paid off, and I was ready to take the next step.

### Nextjs and My First Job

Working 8 hours a day in a professional setting was much different from working on personal projects in college. Up to this point I had only written React with class components in plain JavaScript and was now writing them with functional components with TypeScript. I became more familiar with various scenarios using react hooks and starting learning my way around Nextjs that was used for all our frontend products.

My first big project was making a website introducing our company. I was the only developer assigned to the project and it was my first time working in a team with a designer and marketer. I had to get familiar with Google Tag Manager and learn some basics about Google Analytics to ensure the marketing team had access to the data they wanted. I also had to be flexible to design and marketing changes and improve my skills as a developer to ensure those visions became a reality. When I wasn't sure if a design or marketing requirment could be translated into code, I made small mockups on codesandbox and shared my results with my team to show what could or couldn't work.

I also saw a lot of people leave and enter the company in a short span of time. For the first four months in my job, someone was leaving every month. My CTO, who had hired me, left the company only after 6 months I started working. I remember feeling quite sad when another junior frontend developer who had started work the same day as me left only after 8 months for another company. Before she left, she had told me that if our lead developers continued to code only in the way they were familiar with, they would not improve much either. I would only realize the meaning of her parting words a year later.

Our company grew and we moved out of working in a wework to a bigger office near Gangnam. I also moved out of my home in Incheon and lived alone in a one-room apartment in Seoul to make commuting to work easier. My last major project was remaking another website promoting our packaging and distribution services. I was the sole developer participating in the project and during mid-development, I got the coronavirus and had to work from home. The company decided to renew the website again a year after I left, but I still have a copy of the [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/OeSEydORz5x7Y8rEq1cPNf/%ED%92%88%EA%B3%A0-%ED%99%88%ED%8E%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%A7%80-%EB%A6%AC%EB%89%B4%EC%96%BC-(Copy)) of what I had worked on.

After finishing the website, I moved teams to work on our packaging and distribution web app. We were trying to modernize our design at the time, and I found that the pre-existing code written with a component UI library was very incompatible with the new design that required more complex UX interactions. We were also using a premium library that we had to pay several thousands of dollars per year to organize our table columns and rows. Our Cypress end-to-end tests were incredibly slow with rows of `cy.wait` and I began to realize that the leadership believed in the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality, which I found quite frustating.

Quitting my first job wasn't an easy decision, but I truly believe that I wouldn't have learned much the longer I had stayed there. If anything, I would have continued to use bad coding practices like writing a `useEffect` in every file that interacted with an api instead of using a common hook that could be reused across all those files.

In the end, I was grateful for the opportunity to work as a junior frontend developer in my first job, but I outgrew the company and decided to move jobs to another company that was more focused on improving existing problems than ignoring them until something broke.

### NFTs, Web3, and My Second Job

I was fortunate enough to get my second job a month after quitting my first one. I had initally accepted the offer thinking that I would be working mainly on the frontend side of integrating audio and machine learning in our services. I didn't think that I would be working on NFTs and web3 because those words were nowhere in the job description. So after an inital project of redesigning the company website with Nextjs and Tailwind, I was again the sole developer of another small team where we were tasked to create a staking web-app for our NFTs.

I had to familiarize myself with a codebase that already had some web3 integration to animate the mouth shapes of NFTs with audio to make it look like they were talking in real-time with text-to-speech. Besides that, I also had to learn the basics of Mobx, Metamask, WalletConnect, and general web3 concepts. And we were given 2 weeks for development.

After many late nights, working on weekends, and testing over the Ethereum network, we were ready to launch. Our original plan was to make the web-app desktop only, but the perfectionist in me decided to make a mobile design on a whim. It wasn't anything pretty, but I made sure the staking web-app was at least functional on a mobile device. 

We launched and began to monitor problems on both the front and backend sides as thousands of NFTs began to be staked at once. We were using Datadog to monitor real-time bugs, and I found out that roughly 40% of users were on their mobile device! I like to believe my decision to make our web-app mobile friendly saved me at least one late night adding media queries to satisfy user complaints on why the website doesn't work on their phones.

![staking](/images/posts/example-post/staking.gif)

After finishing my first web3 project, I was assgined to another web3 project for creating custom NFTs via user recorded audio. We were given a month before launch. Our team comprised of 4 frontend developers, and I volunteered to take care of the authentication because I was confident I could do it since I had some previous web3 experience compared to the other developers who had none. I thought I could finish authentication in a week. It actually took three, even with all the overtime and weekends I worked. Looking back, if we had used a library like [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started), I the development speed would have been much faster instead of doing everything by hand with Redux and React Context. But our team was still new to web3 and with the help of Chakra UI and React Query, we launched our custom voice NFT creation service a few days after the deadline.

After working on some additional feaures, I was finally assigned work on integrating audio on our alpha web app service.
