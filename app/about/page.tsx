      <h2>About <span className="text-gradient">Elijah Lee</span></h2>
      <p>Hey, I&apos;m Elijah! I started making websites with WordPress as a freshman college student in 2015 as a hobby. That passion persisted for years as I learned more and more about the vast and ever-growing world of frontend development. I love how coding allows me to create what I want, so long as I have the skillset to do so.</p>
      <p>I have 2+ years of professional experience working as a frontend developer. I have done everything from creating that pixel-perfect layout with CSS, managing and debugging complex client and server states with Redux and React Query, and even working with web3 and NFTs. And I am always open to learning something new.</p>
